# Subject Recognition From a given Image using K Nearest Neighbors

The VidTIMIT dataset consists of video and audio recordings of 43 subjects reciting short sentences. 
In this assignment, we will use a subset of the dataset with 25 subjects. We will also use only the video modality.
The videos were sliced into images and the discrete cosine transform function was used to extract feature vectors 
of dimension 100 from each image. The training set contains 3,500 samples and the test set contains 1,000 samples.
Our objective is to recognize a subject from a given image
